Rholang is a behaviorally typed, concurrent programming language, with a focus on message-passing and formally modeled by the ρ-calculus, a reflective, higher-order extension of the π-calculus. It is designed to be used to implement protocols and "smart contracts" on a general-purpose blockchain, but could be used in other settings as well.

The language is still in the early stages of development, but for those who are interested, more information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/synereo/rholang/wiki).
